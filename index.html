    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h3 id="section1">Abstract</h3>
    <p>
        Repurposing old hardware like GPUs can reduce electronic waste and environmental detriments whilst also supporting education and research. When combined into clusters, older GPUs can still provide strong parallel computing power for academic and scientific applications, reducing the current high demand of new hardware. Extending their lifespan cuts carbon emissions, reduces harmful landfill e-waste and reduces demand for mined resources.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h3 id="section2">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Electronic waste has become a critical environmental concern, with discarded computer hardware contributing to global waste streams. Of the many components, GPUs have high potential computing power if used correctly. Huang's Law states that the GPU performance more than doubles every two years which would mean after 4-6 years older GPUs would not be able to compete with the newer ones individually. However, when put together in GPU clusters, they can be powerful and effectively leveraged for areas such as academic computing, simulations for scientific/academic purposes or even AI. A GPU cluster is a networked system of multiple GPUs working together to perform computing tasks through parallel processing. Parallel processing is a mode of operation in which a process is split into parts, which are executed simultaneously on different processors attached to the same computer. This allows workload division, allowing the cluster to process tasks that require a large amount of computing power which would otherwise not be possible by a single GPU.

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h3 id="section3">What are GPUs and why they matter</h3>
    <p>
        A GPU is a specialised electronic circuit designed to accelerate the rendering of images and videos, especially 3D graphics. GPUs contain hundred to thousands of smaller cores all able to perform calculations independently, this differs from a CPU which only has a few very powerful cores designed to complete only a handful of tasks at one given time. A GPU can perform mathematical equations at very high speeds and is optimised to handle multiple tasks on large sets of data simultaneously making it effective not only for graphics but also tasks including artificial intelligence and scientific computing. The demand for GPU power has exploded with AI and high-performance computing including gaming, which is becoming increasingly realistic and has increasing demands from consumers to have large open worlds which require immense rendering power. This means that hardware upgrades become more frequent leading to many obsolete GPUs.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h3 id="section4">The problem with obsolete GPUs and e-waste</h3>
    <p>
        When GPUs become too old for high-end gaming, academic/scientific purposes or AI, users and data centres may retire them earlier than needed instead of repurposing them. E-waste refers to discarded electronic devices, it poses environmental and health risks due to hazardous toxic materials like mercury, cadmium and lead. When improperly discarded, these non-biodegradable substances cause pollution through open burning, acid leaching (extracting metals by dissolving objects in acid), and dumping. This contaminates groundwater, releases fumes and harms ecosystems and human health. Some of the many health issues include respiratory issues, neurological damage and birth defects. A reliable source states that 62 million tonnes of e-waste were produced globally in 2022, and it is rising annually by 2.6 million tonnes, with projections reaching 82 million tonnes by 2030. This data highlights the rapid increase in e-waste generation and the associated environmental challenges (Baldé et al., 2024). Repurposing and repair can boost e-waste collection and recycling rates from the current global documented level of 22.3% in 2022 to 60% by 2030, avoiding substantial waste volumes through extended product lifespans and resource recovery (DTP Group, 2025).

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <h3 id="section5">What repurposed GPUs would be used for</h3>
    <p>
        Many academic and educational workloads are far less demanding than industry AI models, this means that older GPUs can be useful if utilised correctly. Some realistic uses in a university/college setting could include teaching students about GPU programming, CUDA/OpenCL, or MATLAB/Python without needing brand-new hardware while still having the computing power to effectively run all programs and software. GPU clusters can also be used for smaller research experiments, simulations and background data processing. Not only is it useful for the university/college itself but also for students who may not be able to afford cloud computing or own their own personal high-end GPUs. Some examples of cloud computing are simulations, artificial intelligence and machine learning, rendering and media processing etc.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <h3 id="section6">Positive environmental impact</h3>
    <p>
        Manufacturing new GPUs is an energy intensive process which emits a significant amount of carbon emissions. By reusing and recycling old hardware, it is viable to reduce a small portion of the environmental footprint associated with the resource collecting and production processes. In addition, this also reduces the volume of GPUs ending up in a landfill and cuts the risk of toxic materials leaching into the soil and water. Despite all these issues and the desire to reduce e-waste completely, not every GPU can be saved forever. Old or damaged units can't be reused and should be recycled correctly. However, by extending their useful life by even a few years, can make a measurable difference at scale which will positively impact our planet.
    </p>
    
    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <h3 id="section7">Challenges and considerations</h3>
    <p>
        Repurposing GPUs comes with technical challenges. Compatibility problems can arise when combining different generations of hardware, including physical form factors, power connectors or even mismatched drivers. Another issue is the energy efficiency of old GPUs; older GPUs might draw more power and operate less efficiently than newer ones, meaning that the negative impacts of energy consumption outweigh the environmental benefits of reuse. Organisational challenges also come into play when thinking about reusing and repurposing old GPUs. Effective reuse means that an individual or organisation needs to manage inventory, test older cards and determine which units remain reliable enough for use. Data centres and laboratory policies may not allow the use of mixed or outdated hardware, favouring standardised, newer equipment for ease of maintenance. Despite many obstacles, carefully designed GPU repurposing holds strong potential to generate lasting educational, environmental and economic benefits. With the correct planning and collaboration, these initiatives can effectively address practical barriers to education and scientific research whilst also contributing to a more sustainable computing environment.
